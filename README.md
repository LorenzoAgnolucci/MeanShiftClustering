## About The Project
![Clustering example](https://github.com/LorenzoAgnolucci/MeanShiftClustering/blob/master/latex/paper_mean_shift_PC/img/example_combined.png)

Sequential C++ and parallel OpenMP and CUDA implementations of Mean Shift clustering algorithm.

For more information, read the [paper](paper_mean_shift_PC.pdf) located in the repo root.

### Built With

* [C++](https://github.com/LorenzoAgnolucci/MeanShiftClustering/blob/master/latex/paper_mean_shift_PC/img/teach_yourself_C%2B%2B_in_21_days.png)
* [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org)
* [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone)


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
Nvidia GPU with CUDA installed and correctly configured.

## Usage

Run ```C++/main.cpp``` for the sequential and OpenMP implementation, ```CUDA/MeanShiftClustering.cu``` for the CUDA implementation.
